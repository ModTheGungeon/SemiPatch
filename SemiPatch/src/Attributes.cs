    /// method exactly, otherwise analysis will fail. It can be called like a
    /// normal delegate within the method, and it can be passed to other methods
    /// or used in other ways like any normal delegate.
    /// 
    /// For example, if patching method:
    /// 
    /// <code>public string SetAge(string name, int number) {...}</code>
    /// 
    /// a normal (overwriting) patch method would look like this:
    /// 
    /// <code>public string SetAge(string name, int number) {...}</code>

    /// [TargetName("SetAge")]
    /// public string MySetAgePatch(string name, int number) {...}
    /// </code>

    /// 
    /// <code>
    /// [ReceiveOriginal]
    /// public string SetAge(Orig&lt;string, int, string&gt; orig, string name, int number) {...}
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// Then, <c>orig</c> can be freely used, for example to alter the return
    /// value of the method:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    /// [ReceiveOriginal]
    /// public string SetAge(Orig&lt;string, int, string&gt; orig, string name, int number) {
    ///     return "foobar" + orig(name, number)
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// If the target method returns <c>void</c>, a variation of the
    /// <see cref="VoidOrig"/> type must be used, and the return type isn't included
    /// in the generic parameters for that type. In any other case, a variation of
    /// <see cref="Orig{}"/> must be used, and the return type is always the last
    /// generic parameter.
    /// 
    /// If static patching is used to inject this method, the method may be heavily
    /// rewritten. In the case of the MonoMod static patch generator, patch methods
    /// tagged with this attribute lose their special first argument. Any invocations
    /// of the <c>orig</c> delegate become direct invocations of the old method,
    /// while more uncommon usage of the delegate (such as passing it to other methods)

    /// initialized with the target method. A reference to this local variable
    /// then replaces any such reference to the <c>orig</c> argument.

    /// This means that with the MonoMod static patcher, directly calling the
    /// orig delegate within a patch method tagged with <c>ReceiveOriginal</c>
    /// will always be optimized down to a simple and direct method call. At the
